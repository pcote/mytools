My Tools
========
MyTools is a collection of personal tools put together for myself that I decided to share on Github.
There's no rhyme or reason as to why they're grouped together.  They just happen to be tools I
keep handy that I use a lot.

Requirements
============
Runs on Python 3.4

The following non-standard libraries are utilized for some of the functions in this module.
** BeautifulSoup 4.3.2
** Requests 2.3

How To Use
==========
Information on how to use My Tools is available in the docstrings within mytools.py
